# Data Industries

This repository holds various data engineer and software engineering exercises. 

This repository is to showcase various data engineering projects with a variety of tools such as AWS, DBT, Python, and SQL.

## Backgrounnd
Data Industries has initiated a transformative project to establish a robust data platform on AWS. Currently, the organization relies on ad hoc data pulls, which often lead to inconsistent data access and discrepancies across teams. To address these challenges, Data Industries aims to build a centralized data repository that will ensure uniform data availability and foster a culture of data-driven decision-making.

The goal of this project is to:

1 - Eliminate data silos and inconsistencies.  
2 - Enable seamless and secure data sharing across the company.  
3 - Lay the groundwork for scalable and efficient data pipelines.  
4 - Empower teams with access to accurate, real-time data for analytics and reporting.  

## Deliverables

The Data Industries data platform project will focus on delivering the following key components:

1. **Architecture Diagram**  
   - A detailed visual representation of the platform's architecture.  
   - The diagram will illustrate how each AWS component integrates into the data workflow, including services such as S3, Redshift, Glue, Lambda, and others.

2. **Architecture Documentation**  
   - A concise write-up describing the architecture.  
   - This document will explain the rationale behind key engineering decisions, including scalability, cost optimization, and performance considerations.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   - Code to provision the AWS infrastructure using tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.  
   - The IaC will ensure consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled deployment of the platform.

4. **Data Pipeline Code**  
   - Python scripts and SQL code to implement and orchestrate data ingestion, transformation, and storage workflows.  
   - Includes best practices for modular, testable, and reusable code.

5. **Monitoring and Logging Setup**  
   - Tools and configurations to monitor platform health and performance.  
   - Includes CloudWatch dashboards, alerting mechanisms, and logging strategies for debugging and auditing.

6. **Usage Documentation**  
   - A guide for end-users and engineers to interact with the platform.  
   - Includes instructions for accessing data, troubleshooting issues, and extending the platform.

These deliverables collectively form the foundation of a scalable, maintainable, and efficient data platform tailored to Data Industries' needs.
